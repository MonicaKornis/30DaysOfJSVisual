# Day 3

A boolean value is either true or false. There are other data types that, when evaluated, equal true. 

* Strings
* The value true 
* numbers 

The following values, equal false, when evaluated: 
 
* 0 
* NaN
* Null
* Undefined 
* the value false 
* Empty strings = "", ' '

## Undefined 

If we declare a variable and do not assign it a value, it will be undefined. Furthermore, when a function does not return a value, it's output will be undefined. 

## Null

If a variable has a value of null, that means that it was purposefully assigned the value of null. The variable has been declared and given the value of null. 

## Operators 

* ** is the exponential operator ex: 3 ** 2 (9)


## Comparison Operators 

* === : if this evaluates to true it means that values are the same in value and in type 
* == : if this evaulates to true, both values only have to be the same in value 

As a rule of thumb, if two values are not equal using == , then they will not be equal using === because === is stricter in it's evaluation of equality.
